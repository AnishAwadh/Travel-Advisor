## Introduction

An advanced Travel Companion Application using Google Maps. 

With Geolocation, Google Maps API, Searching for places, Fetching restaurants, hotels and attractions based on location from specialized Rapid APIs, data filtering and much more, this Travel Advisor App is the best Maps Application that you can currently find on YouTube and on the entire internet.

    - MVC(Model View Controller) - folder & file structure 
    - hooks and refs

- Working with Google Maps API and Geolocation for map structure.
- And most importantly fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI allowed me to test and explore best APIs for this project.
